![](img/dtla_history.png)

The csv file contains 117 years of downtown Los Angeles weather data. 
For the most part, Los Angeles is dry and warm, but winters see some 
heavy rainfall and cold days. Los Angeles climate can be classified as 
Mediterranean, meaning the winters are mild and wet while the summers 
are hot and dry. Over the past century, the average temperature in 
downtown Los Angeles has increased by about 3 degrees Fahrenheit, 
and there has been a trend toward less precipitation overall, with 
some years experiencing severe drought conditions. However, there is 
still considerable variability from year to year, and extreme weather 
events like heat waves and intense rainstorms are a dependable part of life in Los Angeles. 
The weather data for Los Angeles is extracted from https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn from 
station USW00093134 (currently on the campus of USC) and cleaned  and prepared with custom scripts.
